perceptron to recognize alphabet, algorithm based on Fundamental of Neural Networks by Laurene Fausett
For the input of this program will be txt file consists of * and o to 'draws' on the alphabet, you can change it if you want and use csv if you are more familiar with it.

Please take a note that the bigger the matrix of the training data (and more data is better), it will be more accurate for the program to identify the alphabet.

This program using training data which is 7 x 9 matrix resulting the program not running optimally.

For upgraded version, MNIST dataset will be used as training data to make the program more accurate.
